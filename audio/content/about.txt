Sunrise Pool Service provides professional pool cleaning and pool water chemistry balancing.  We also operate, maintain, and inspect the pool equipment.  The pool cleaning routine includes but is not limited to vacuuming, netting, brushing all surfaces, emptying skimmer baskets, cleaning the lint pot, and checking and adjusting pool chemistry. We also clean filters, acid wash salt cells, and other equipment specific routines according to suggested schedules of maintenance. 
We are experts in swimming pool water chemistry and sanitation and use technically precise chemical testing methods and procedures to balance pool water according to the Langlier Saturation Index, which is an objective measurement of water balance.
The full service schedules and rates are: weekly service ($55/visit), Biweekly service ($60/visit), and monthly service ($78/visit). A partial service consisting of only a chemical check and adjustment is also available for $35/visit. All of these rates DO NOT include the price of chemicals.
There is a lot to learn and know about the proper care and operation of a swimming pool. We guide and educate our clients in the methods of that care and what is best for their pool depending on the season and circumstances. The best pool care is preventative, performing basic maintenance routines frequently enough to meet the various seasonal demands is essential to the longevity and enjoyment of your pool. We help you to design a maintenance regimen that fits your needs, your time, and your budget.
We look forward to meeting and working together with you!
