                            <p>There are many reasons why your swimming pool water may have a green appearance to it.
                                Some of these reasons include algae growth from phosphates or having metals in the
                                water. Algae has the ability to grow rapidly, especially during the warm summer months.
                                When it happens quickly, it’s likely due to an imbalance or a lack of chlorine in your
                                pool water. Chlorine serves as a sanitizer, and if you let the chlorine levels drop for
                                even one day, an algae outbreak can occur. Be sure to check your pool’s chlorine level
                                often or have our professional team members do it for you.</p>

                            <p>Algae requires nutrients, sunlight, and somewhere to grow. The best way to prevent algae
                                from growing in your swimming pool is by maintaining the proper sanitizer level and
                                brushing. Algae needs to have a surface to cling onto and grow on, so brushing it will
                                prevent it from hiding in crevices. Green algae is common in pools and most frequently
                                occurs after a few days of high heat in the summertime. Black algae can show up in areas
                                with poor circulation, such as deep end corners, step corners, or behind ladders. Yellow
                                algae is resistant to chlorine, so be sure to call in our team of experts for
                                assistance. Algae can be transferred from pool to pool, so be sure to wash your bathing

                                pool properly! Your pool may require extra measures to minimize the amount of hair that
                                ends up in the pool. If your pet swims regularly clean the filter often to ensure the
                                pump functions at optimal levels</p>
                            <p>If your pup has long hair or sheds a lot, give him adequate brushing before allowing him
                                in your pool, to minimize the amount of hair that ends up in your pool filter. If your
                                dog swims regularly, clean your filter frequently, to ensure your pool pump continues
                                working at the optimum level.</p>
                            <p>
                                Keeping your dog’s nails trimmed can also reduce the chance of damage to not only pool
                                equipment, but other swimmers. It is not recommended to allow a dog in a vinyl pool,
                                since his nails can cause damage.</p>
                            <p>
                                Dogs can also transfer debris like dirt and pollen, into your pool. However, many pool
                                experts suggest that one dog in a swimming pool has the same effect on pool water as
                                three humans.</p>
                            <p>

                                Just like sharing treats or going on a hike together, spending time with your dog in the
                                pool can create lots of laughter and lasting memories for many years to come. With
                                patience and proper attention, the answer to “can dogs swim in pools” is YES!</p>

                                the way to go. With that being said, the best way to prepare your pool depends on
                                whether your location receives a heavy snowfall or it is relatively warm
                            <p> Deep clean the pool: Scrub the pool vigorously to remove all algae spores and sediments.
                                Once you are done, vacuum the pool.

                                Test the water: Test for pH levels, balance the water chemistry and add winterizing

                            <p>
                                Clean the filter: Clean the filter and blow out your lines correctly. You may need to
                                use antifreeze – but check the temperature rating on it first.

                            <p> Pool circulation is what keeps the water in a pool moving, so that it doesn’t get
                                stagnant and dirty. Pool jets not only circulate the water, but they help to distribute
                                chemicals throughout the pool to keep it clean and sanitary.

                                How can I make sure the pool water is circulating correctly?
                                What you can do as the pool owner, is check to make sure that dirty water is going into
                                your pool filter, and clean water is returning to the pool. To keep water flowing
                                correctly, you’ll want to run your pool pump 8-12 hours a day, regularly clean the
                                skimmer and pump basket, and face the jets downward and circular to keep a steady flow.

                            <p>Brush the walls, ladder, steps, and any other low circulation spots daily!
                            </p>
                            <p>Skim the pool surgace daily</p>
