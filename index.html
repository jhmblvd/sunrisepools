                            <p>The secret to a clean, safe pool is consistent and repeated performance of a good
                                maintenance routine. Preventative maintenance is far superior (and overall cheaper!)
                                than reactive maintenance. Much like going to the gym, good results are cumulative and
                                depend on consistency. You can trust our technicians to keep your pool maintenance on
                                schedule and give your pool the regular “work-out” it needs.</p>

                            <p>Brushing a pool is one of the best ways to keep it clean and healthy. Dirt, algae, and
                                microorganisms hide on the walls, stairs, corners and other low circulation areas of
                                your pool waiting to take advantage and proliferate if chlorine coverage is lost.
                                Brushing at least once a week in the summer results in an overall cleaner pool with less
                                algae.

                            <p>A pool can be green from a chemical imbalance or the presence of metals in the pool.
                                However, the most common cause of a green pool is algae. Algae is a microorganism that
                                uses the sun and nearly every contaminant you find in pool water, to grow and
                                proliferate, even exponentially. Chlorine is arguably the most important element in
                                preventing algae growth. The key is this: Chlorine does not stay in swimming pools. It
                                is constantly dissipating and being destroyed or neutralized by the sun or in chemical
                                interaction with waste products and microorganisms. Chlorine must be added every day
                                during the peak of the season. Salt systems and chemical feeders do this for you if you
                                have them, but even then, in some high use circumstances (big parties, daily swimming,
                                dogs swimming, an active algae bloom etc…) these automatic chlorine feeders might not
                                keep up with the demand, requiring you to add chlorine directly to the pool. Because, as
                                soon as chlorine levels reach zero algae begins to bloom. And when conditions are right,
                                the pool can go from clear to completely green in a matter of hours!</p>

                        <h5 class="ac-title">What causes algae in a swimming pool? Is it my lake shorts?</h5>
                        <div class="ac-content">
                            <p>We have all heard the adage “if you swim in the pool with the shorts you use to swim in
                                the lake your pool will turn green”. Its probably one of the most widely known and
                                believed pieces of pool maintenance advice we encounter. But is it true? In some sense
                                it is reasonable to think that algae spores from the lake could adhere to your shorts
                                and later transfer to your pool and cause an algae bloom. But it is also true that algae
                                spores are literally everywhere, and the pool is constantly being seeded with algae
                                spores floating on the air. The most important factor in algae growth in a pool is not
                                the introduction of spores, but whether the spores encounter chlorine and properly
                                balanced pool water. Algae spores die immediately or eventually in a well maintained
                                properly balanced pool with chlorine residual, whether they are from the air or from the
                                lake. The cause of algae in a swimming pool largely boils down to the lack of chlorine.

                        <div class="ac-content">
                            <p>There are some harmful types of algae, but they are rarely found in swimming pools. Algae
                                found in pools usually does not pose a direct threat. That said, algae in a pool is
                                taxing on water chemistry and chlorine levels. These in turn can cause more direct
                                problems like skin and eye irritation or worse, allow dangerous microorganisms to live
                                and thrive. If swimming pool water is clear and there is at least a chlorine residual of
                                1ppm, then the presence of algae in certain places in the pool like walls, corners, or
                                stairs is not cause for concern to the health of swimmers. If, however, the entire pool
                                is covered in algae and/or the bottom of the pool is not visible, swimming is not
                                advised.

                            <p>Proper pool care takes time and effort. Our trained technicians use industry leading pool
                                cleaning equipment and water testing methods to provide the best level of pool care you
                                can find. Maintaining your own pool is time consuming and not always as straight forward
                                as it might seem, with many different methods and approaches appearing to give good
                                results. But appearances can be deceiving. We often work with pools and spas that on
                                first sight seem to have clear clean water, but on closer inspection are discovered to
                                be far out of balance or worse possibly harboring dangerous microorganisms. Chlorine is
                                not enough. Parameters like pH, Alkalinity, calcium hardness, and even temperature (just
                                to name a few) must be measured and adjusted to maintain truly safe, balanced pool and
                                spa water. We bring the chemicals and our expertise to you (no more trips to the pool
                                store with water samples!) and when the service is complete you receive a detailed
                                report as to what work was done, water chemistry results, chemicals added and any other
                                pertinent details of the service (including photos). We also store all this information
                                in our system for easy reference and to help us better understand your pools specific

                        <div class="ac-content">
                            <p>One of the benefits of a pool that is regularly maintained is a steadier pool chemistry.
                                This means that it will usually need only small changes or additions of pool chemicals
                                to keep it balanced and sanitized. For this reason, most of our clients on regular
                                service will at most only need to wait 30 minutes after the service, if at all, before
                                jumping back in. Unless we inform you otherwise you can assume this to be the case. A
                                pool that is being shocked will have a wait time of 24-48 hrs. before swimming can be
                                resumed. It is rare for a regularly maintained pool to need to be shocked, if it does it
                                could be a sign it needs more frequent servicing. </p>

                        <div class="ac-content">
                            <p>Every pool has a certain amount of waste products and contaminants being constantly
                                introduced from the environment and any people or animals entering the water. It is
                                chlorine's job to neutralize and destroy these compounds. This amount we refer to as the
                                chlorine demand. At a specific pool, It’s the amount of chlorine required to neutralize
                                all waste products, keeping the pool sanitized and clear. This chlorine demand, or need
                                for chlorine, can vary from near zero in the middle of winter, to almost constant in the
                                summer.</p>
                            <p>Unpleasant as it might be, it is worth considering the amount of sweat, lotions,
                                cosmetics, deodorants and perfumes that are regularly brought into a pool by swimmers,
                                sometimes referred to as the “bather load”. One active adult swimmer alone can release
                                up to 1 pint of sweat per hour! Not only does it take a lot of chlorine to deal with
                                this bather load, but all these waste products are food for algae which proliferate and
                                further increase chlorine demand. If a pools chlorine demand is not continually met, it
                                gets cloudy and then turns green. The amount of chlorine it will take to restore the
                                pool will not only be larger than if the initial chlorine demand had been met but will
                                continue to increase.</p>

                        <div class="ac-content">
                            <p>Most often when this happens the reason is due to a large “chlorine debt” as we sometimes
                                call it. This basically means that there is so much buildup of waste products and/or
                                algae in your pool, that as soon as you add chlorine it gets completely used up
                                destroying contaminants. Its important to understand that first, chlorine gets used up
                                when it destroys waste products and two, a specific amount of chlorine will be required
                                to completely destroy a specific amount of waste products. Your test strips will
                                continue to read 0 even after adding chlorine until you have added enough chlorine to
                                destroy all waste products in the pool, at which point the addition of more chlorine
                                will then begin to register on your strips (this is residual chlorine waiting in the
                                water to attack new waste products). The longer a pool goes without residual chlorine
                                the more chlorine it will take to bring residual chlorine back to the pool. </p>

                            <p>The word shock is confusing, sometimes it’s used as a noun such as “we bought bags of
                                shock”, sometimes it’s used like a verb, “we had to shock the pool after our pool
                                party”. In the first instance “shock” is a synonym for chlorine. And so, any type of
                                chlorine, liquid or dry, might be referred to as “shock”. When used as a verb “shock”
                                means adding enough chlorine (or shock) to bring the chlorine residuals up to 10, 20, or
                                sometimes 30+ ppm. This might be done to fight algae or decontaminate after a fecal

                                underestimate how much dirt and dust floats around. It’s likely no coincidence that we

                                inside heat up. At night when the pump shuts off and water stops moving, the water
                                that’s inside the salt cell heats up a lot from the heat on the plates. This hot water
                                and the high pH cause scale to form all over the metal plates. In the morning when the

                                pool before needing to replace the liner. It is important to know that the life of any
                                of these types of pools can either be lengthened or shortened by water chemistry and
                                regular maintenance. Chronically aggressive water over the years will corrode and
                                destroy all the different pool types, sometimes shortening the life of the pool by half!
                                Poorly maintained pools are more expensive in the long run than a professionally cared
                                for swimming pool.</p>

                            <p>Sure! As beloved family members we include them in most of our other recreational
                                activities so why not swimming? The most important thing to keep in mind is safety. Dogs
                                should always be supervised when swimming. Second, proper pool chemistry is vital for
                                ensuring the water is not only safe for our dogs but able to deal with the additional
                                demand dogs place on pool water chemistry. One medium sized dog brings in as much dirt,
                                debris, and hair as 3 or more adults (not to mention particles of fecal matter) into the
                                pool. None of which is of much concern in a well maintained chemically balanced swimming
                                pool.</p>
                            <!-- <p>If you decide to let your furry friend swim in your pool it is important to maintain your
                                pool properly! Your pool may require extra measures to minimize the amount of hair that
                                ends up in the pool. If your pet swims regularly clean the filter often to ensure the
                                pump functions at optimal levels</p>
                            <p>If your pup has long hair or sheds a lot, give him adequate brushing before allowing him
                                in your pool, to minimize the amount of hair that ends up in your pool filter. If your
                                dog swims regularly, clean your filter frequently, to ensure your pool pump continues
                                working at the optimum level.</p>
                            <p>
                                Keeping your dog’s nails trimmed can also reduce the chance of damage to not only pool
                                equipment, but other swimmers. It is not recommended to allow a dog in a vinyl pool,
                                since his nails can cause damage.</p>
                            <p>
                                Dogs can also transfer debris like dirt and pollen, into your pool. However, many pool
                                experts suggest that one dog in a swimming pool has the same effect on pool water as
                                three humans.</p>

                                Just like sharing treats or going on a hike together, spending time with your dog in the
                                pool can create lots of laughter and lasting memories for many years to come. With

                            <p>Lots of confusion surrounds winterizing a swimming pool. There are several ways of going
                                about it depending on the situation and climate. If a pool has the appropriate safety
                                cover installed, then it can be shocked and covered in the winter. Some people then
                                drain all the equipment and let the pool sit dead. The better option in our opinion is
                                to continue running the pump a few hours at night and making sure a thermostat is
                                installed to turn the pump on if temperatures reach freezing. Most people do not have
                                the expensive professionally installed safety covers for their pool. In this case we
                                recommend simply continuing to maintain the pool, servicing it every other week or once
                                per month and running the pump at night and/or ensuring the pump has a freeze protection
                                thermostat.

                                Trying to cover a pool with a tarp or anything other than a professionally installed
                                cover is dangerous and NOT RECOMMENDED. In 9 out of 10 cases where we have seen this
                                done, it usually creates more mess and trouble than its worth. Furthermore, Animals and
                                children or people who fall in can easily get tangled up and drown. Animals do not
                                realize there is water under a tarped pool. Tarping a pool is a great way to create a

                            <p>Chlorine does not stay in swimming pools. In commercial settings health departments

                                chlorine can go from normal levels to zero within hours. And as soon as chlorine levels
                                reach zero, algae and other microorganisms (some of them dangerous) can proliferate,
                                sometimes exponentially. For residential settings testing for chlorine no less than
                                every week is advised, sometimes more if circumstances require. Testing for chlorine is
                                arguably the one thing ALL pool owners should know how to do and should do regularly
                                during peak usage. It is easy and inexpensive to perform a test for chlorine (test
